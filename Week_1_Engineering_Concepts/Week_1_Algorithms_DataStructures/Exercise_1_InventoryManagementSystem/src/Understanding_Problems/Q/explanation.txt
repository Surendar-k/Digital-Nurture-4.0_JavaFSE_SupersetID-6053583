1. ) Understand the Problem:
Explain why data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories.
Discuss the types of data structures suitable for this problem.

i) 
Efficiency: In large inventories, operations like searching, updating, or deleting products must be fast. Poor data structure choices can lead to high time complexity and degraded performance.
Scalability: Proper data structures ensure the system remains efficient as the inventory grows.
Maintainability: Clear algorithms and well-chosen structures reduce bugs and improve code readability and maintenance.


ii)
ArrayList: Good for ordered data and iteration. Slower search/update/delete by productId.
HashMap (recommended): Key-value mapping, ideal for quick access by productId. Operations (add, update, delete) generally in O(1) time.
TreeMap: Maintains sorted order of keys but slower (O(log n)) operations.
