1.	Understand Asymptotic Notation:
Explain Big O notation and how it helps in analyzing algorithms.
Describe the best, average, and worst-case scenarios for search operations.



i)
Big O Notation 
It describes how fast an algorithm runs as input size grows.
Helps compare performance and scalability.

Examples:

O(1): Constant time

O(n): Linear time

O(log n): Logarithmic time 



ii)
Search Operation Cases


Linear Search
Best: O(1) - First item matches

Average: O(n) - Somewhere in the middle

Worst: O(n) - Last item or not found

Binary Search (sorted data only)
Best: O(1) - Middle item

Average: O(log n)

Worst: O(log n)
